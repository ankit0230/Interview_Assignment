# The application must print the characters from the files in the opposite order they appear.
 
For example, given a file named "file1", containing:
 
file1line1
file2line2
 
And a "file2", containing:
 
file2line1
file2line2
 
When run with the arguments "file1" "file2", the program must output:
 
2enil2elif
1enil2elif
2enil1elif
1enil1elif
